## Run: Issue #235 — Division by zero test coverage

- **Branch:** task/issue-235-division-by-zero
- **Target PR branch:** exp2/expert-team
- **Date:** 2026-04-22

### Files changed
- `tests/test_calculator.py` — added 28 tests covering division by zero (integer and float zero denominators), happy path division, zero numerator, floating-point, and numeric extremes

### Purpose
Add focused test coverage asserting that `Calculator.divide()` raises `ZeroDivisionError` on division by zero. No source changes were required — Python's native `/` operator already raises `ZeroDivisionError` correctly.

### Risks
None identified. Only test file modified; no production code changed.

### Test results
28 passed, 0 failed, 0 errors (0.03s)

### Tokens / cost / turns
Duration: 155.1s | Cost: $0.393760 USD | Turns: 14

## Run: Diagram update — Calculator class and divide flow

- **Branch:** task/issue-235-division-by-zero
- **Date:** 2026-04-22

### Files changed
- `artifacts/class_calculator.puml` — class diagram for Calculator with module-level dependencies
- `artifacts/activity_divide.puml` — activity diagram for the two divide() execution paths
- `artifacts/sequence_main.puml` — sequence diagram for __main__.py::main() interactions

### Purpose
Add PlantUML diagrams documenting the Calculator class structure, divide() activity flow, and main() sequence for the division-by-zero feature branch.

### Risks
None. Documentation-only changes; no source or test files modified.

### Test results
N/A — no code changes.
