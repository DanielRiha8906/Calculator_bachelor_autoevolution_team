## Run: Issue #9 — V1 Task 1 - ZeroDivisionError - Expert/team

Branch: task/issue-9-zero-division-error
PR target: exp/expert-team

Files changed:
- tests/test_calculator.py — added test_divide_by_zero and 22 edge-case tests covering integer/float zero divisors, negative numerators, large numerators, 0/0, and IEEE 754 negative zero

Purpose: Add focused test coverage asserting Calculator.divide raises ZeroDivisionError on zero divisors. No implementation change was needed — the native Python / operator already raises ZeroDivisionError.

Risks: None. Change is purely additive (test-only). No production code was modified.

Test results: 23 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped (python -m pytest)
