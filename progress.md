## Run: Issue #235 — Division by zero test coverage

- **Branch:** task/issue-235-division-by-zero
- **Target PR branch:** exp2/expert-team
- **Date:** 2026-04-22

### Files changed
- `tests/test_calculator.py` — added 28 tests covering division by zero (integer and float zero denominators), happy path division, zero numerator, floating-point, and numeric extremes

### Purpose
Add focused test coverage asserting that `Calculator.divide()` raises `ZeroDivisionError` on division by zero. No source changes were required — Python's native `/` operator already raises `ZeroDivisionError` correctly.

### Risks
None identified. Only test file modified; no production code changed.

### Test results
28 passed, 0 failed, 0 errors (0.03s)

### Tokens / cost / turns
Duration: PENDING | Cost: PENDING | Turns: PENDING
