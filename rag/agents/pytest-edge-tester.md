# RAG: pytest-edge-tester

## Purpose
Accumulated testing context for this experiment branch. Each cycle entry records the phase (WRITE/VERIFY), test patterns applied, edge cases discovered, and any escalations made to the implementer.

## Cycle Log

### Cycle 1 (2026-04-24)
**Task:** Issue #373 — Division by Zero  
**Phase:** WRITE  
**Test Cases Added:** 3  
- `test_divide_by_zero_integer` — divide(10, 0) raises ZeroDivisionError
- `test_divide_by_zero_float` — divide(10.5, 0.0) raises ZeroDivisionError
- `test_divide_by_zero_mixed` — divide(7, 0.0) raises ZeroDivisionError

**Test Status:** All 3 tests PASS immediately. This is expected behavior — Python's native `/` operator raises ZeroDivisionError natively, and the current `Calculator.divide()` implementation correctly propagates this exception. The tests confirm correct handling without requiring implementation changes.

**Patterns Found:** 
- Test file structure uses pytest fixtures for calculator instantiation
- Exception testing uses `pytest.raises()` context manager
- Calculator class is minimal (no explicit error handling needed)

**Handoff Notes:** 
All three test specifications from the architect have been implemented and are passing. Since the current implementation already handles division by zero correctly through Python's native behavior, the implementer may determine that no source code changes are required. The tests serve as regression coverage for this behavior.

### Cycle 2 (2026-04-24)
**Task:** Issue #376 — Unit Test Suite (Comprehensive)  
**Phase:** WRITE  
**Test Cases Added:** 49 new tests  
- **Category 1 (Addition):** 9 parametrized tests covering positive integers, negative integers, mixed signs, zero, floats, and large numbers  
- **Category 2 (Subtraction):** 9 parametrized tests covering similar scenarios  
- **Category 3 (Multiplication):** 10 parametrized tests including zero, one, and large numbers  
- **Category 4 (Division):** 7 new tests (3 existing division-by-zero tests preserved)  
- **Category 5 (Invalid Input):** 6 parametrized TypeError tests + 2 special behavior tests (string repetition, bool-as-int)  
- **Category 6 (Cross-Operation):** 6 tests for commutativity, non-commutativity, and inverse relationships  

**Test Status:** ALL 52 TESTS PASS (3 existing + 49 new). This is unexpected for WRITE phase. Investigation shows:
- The Calculator class already has full, correct implementations for all four operations
- All implementations use Python's native operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
- Python's native error handling correctly propagates TypeError and ZeroDivisionError
- Edge cases like bool-as-int and string repetition work as expected in Python
- No implementation gaps exist; all new tests reveal working, correct code

**Patterns Found:**  
- Parametrized tests with `@pytest.mark.parametrize` consolidate similar test cases efficiently  
- `pytest.approx()` handles floating-point precision correctly  
- `pytest.raises()` context manager confirms exception behavior  
- Calculator methods require NO type checking; Python handles type errors natively  

**Handoff Notes:** 
All 49 new test specifications have been written and are passing. Since the implementation is already complete and correct, no source code changes are required. The python-code-implementer should confirm this finding. The test suite now provides comprehensive regression coverage for all operations, edge cases, and error conditions. Tests can proceed to VERIFY phase.

### Cycle 3 (2026-04-24)
**Task:** Issue #376 — Unit Test Suite (VERIFY Phase)  
**Phase:** VERIFY  
**Test Execution:** Full test suite run via `python -m pytest tests/test_calculator.py -v`

**Results:**
- Total tests run: 52
- Tests passing: 52 (100%)
- Tests failing: 0
- Suite status: **GREEN** ✓

**All Test Categories Confirmed:**
- Addition tests (9): All pass
- Subtraction tests (9): All pass
- Multiplication tests (10): All pass
- Division tests (10, including 3 division-by-zero): All pass
- Invalid input/TypeError tests (6): All pass
- Cross-operation/property tests (8): All pass

**Assessment:** The full test suite is GREEN. All tests pass without failure. The Calculator implementation is correct and complete for all specified operations and edge cases. No escalations needed.

**Handoff Notes:** Test suite verification complete. Ready for orchestrator to finalize commit and PR.
