# RAG: python-code-implementer

## Purpose
Accumulated implementation context for this experiment branch. Each cycle entry records files changed, implementation decisions made to satisfy failing tests, and patterns or pitfalls found in `src/`.

## Cycle Log

### 2026-04-24 — issue-372 div-by-zero verification
- Task: Confirm `src/calculator.py` divide method satisfies 5 new tests for division by zero, normal division, float division, negative divisor, and zero dividend.
- Files changed: none (no src/ changes required).
- Decision: Python's native `/` operator already raises `ZeroDivisionError` automatically when divisor is 0. All 5 tests passed without modification.
- Pattern: Python's built-in arithmetic already handles zero-division; no explicit guard is needed in `divide()`.
- Handoff notes: No implementation work was required. Tests were already green on read.
