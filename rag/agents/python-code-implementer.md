## Purpose
Accumulated implementation context for this experiment branch. Each cycle entry records files changed, implementation decisions made to satisfy failing tests, and patterns or pitfalls found in `src/`.

### 2026-04-24 — Add factorial method to Calculator

**Task:** Implement `Calculator.factorial(n: int) -> int` to make 21 failing tests pass.

**Files changed:**
- `src/calculator.py` — added `factorial` method after `divide`; iterative implementation with ordered type guards (bool before float/int due to Python's `bool` subclassing `int`)
- `src/__main__.py` — added `print("Factorial:", calc.factorial(5))` demonstration line

**Key decisions:**
- Bool guard (`isinstance(n, bool)`) placed first because `bool` is a subclass of `int`; without this, `True`/`False` would pass the int check silently.
- None guard uses identity check (`n is None`) rather than `isinstance` to be explicit.
- Catch-all `not isinstance(n, int)` placed last to handle any other unexpected types.
- Iterative loop preferred over `math.factorial` to avoid a hidden dependency and keep the implementation self-contained.

**Patterns found:**
- In Python, always check `bool` before `int` when type-dispatching, since `bool` is a subclass of `int`.
- The existing Calculator class has no type validation on other methods (add, subtract, multiply, divide). The architect specified validation only for factorial; other methods were left untouched.

**Test result:** 73/73 passed (52 pre-existing + 21 new factorial tests).

**Handoff notes for next agent:** No new dependencies introduced. The other Calculator methods still lack input validation — a future task could add it, but that would require new failing tests first (TDD pipeline).
