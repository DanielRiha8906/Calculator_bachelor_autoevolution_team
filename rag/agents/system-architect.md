# RAG: system-architect

## Purpose
Accumulated architectural context for this experiment branch. Each cycle entry records key design decisions, patterns observed in `src/`, and handoff notes for the next invocation.

### 2026-04-24 — Issue #376 V3 Task 2 — Comprehensive Calculator Test Suite Plan

**Task:** Create comprehensive unit test suite for all calculator operations without modifying `src/` logic.

**Key Decisions:**
- Test-only task: zero source code changes to `src/calculator.py` or `src/__main__.py`
- Preserve existing 3 division-by-zero tests; add ~50 new tests covering add, subtract, multiply, divide
- Invalid input tests document actual Python behavior (not prescriptive fixes)
- All floating-point tests use pytest.approx() for precision tolerance
- Organize tests by operation then by scenario type (normal inputs, edge cases, invalid inputs, consistency)

**Architecture Observations:**
- Calculator class is minimal (4 methods, no type checking, no input validation)
- Existing test file has only 3 tests focused on division by zero
- No __init__.py in tests/ directory (simple flat structure)
- Test organization by operation makes maintenance and coverage verification easier

**Patterns Found:**
- pytest fixture pattern already established with `calc` fixture
- All operations perform raw Python operations (a + b, a - b, etc.) with no defensive checks

**Test Specifications Provided:**
- Addition: 9 tests (positive, negative, zero cases, floats, large numbers)
- Subtraction: 9 tests (positive, negative, zero cases, floats, large numbers)
- Multiplication: 10 tests (positive, negative, zero cases, floats, identity element)
- Division: 10 tests (existing 3 + 7 new, floats, zero dividend, zero divisor, large numbers)
- Invalid inputs: 8 tests (strings, None, type mismatches)
- Consistency/cross-operation: 6 tests (inverse operations, commutativity, non-commutativity)

**Handoff to pytest-edge-tester (WRITE):**
Implement ~52 test scenarios in `tests/test_calculator.py`. Keep existing 3 division-by-zero tests. All new tests must initially fail (not yet implemented). Organize by operation for clarity. Use pytest.approx() for floating-point comparisons.

**Handoff to python-code-implementer:**
NO SOURCE CHANGES REQUIRED. This task is test-only. If pytest-edge-tester produces failing tests, the implementer should not modify `src/` to make them pass — only the test suite is being built. The calculator implementation remains as-is.

### 2026-04-24 — Issue #379 — Factorial Operation Feature — DETAILED PLAN EMITTED

**Task:** Add factorial operation to Calculator class. Must handle valid non-negative integers (0→1, 1→1, n≥2→n!), explicitly reject negative integers (ValueError), and reject non-integer types (bool, float, str, None with ValueError).

**Key Decisions:**
- Single new method `factorial(self, n: int) -> int` added to Calculator class.
- Iterative (not recursive) implementation to avoid stack overflow on large n.
- Type validation executed first (bool, float, str, None all rejected with ValueError before value check).
- Value validation executed second (negative integers rejected with ValueError).
- Optional single-line demo added to `src/__main__.py` showing `calc.factorial(5)`.
- Unary operation; does not change class API or require refactoring.

**Architecture Observations (confirmed in source exploration):**
- Calculator class at `/home/runner/work/Calculator_bachelor_autoevolution_team/Calculator_bachelor_autoevolution_team/src/calculator.py` contains 4 methods (add, subtract, multiply, divide), no __init__, pure functions.
- Existing methods perform raw Python operations with no defensive validation.
- Factorial introduces first unary operation but fits existing single-responsibility pattern.
- Type validation for factorial more strict than binary ops, justified by mathematical domain.
- Tests file at `/home/runner/work/Calculator_bachelor_autoevolution_team/Calculator_bachelor_autoevolution_team/tests/test_calculator.py` already contains 3 division tests and 52+ other tests from V3 Task 2.

**Test Specifications Provided to pytest-edge-tester (WRITE):**
- Category 1 (Valid non-negative): 4 tests (0, 1, parametrized 2-10, large 20).
- Category 2 (Negative): 1 parametrized test (-1, -5, -100).
- Category 3 (Non-integers): 4 tests (float, string, None, bool).
- Category 4 (Type/edge): 2 tests (return type is int, match math.factorial).
- Total: 11 test functions with ~15 individual assertions when parametrized.

**Source Changes Plan for python-code-implementer:**
- File 1: `src/calculator.py` — Add method `factorial(self, n: int) -> int` with full input validation (type + value) and iterative computation. Placement: after divide method, before blank line.
- File 2 (optional): `src/__main__.py` — Add single print line `print("Factorial:", calc.factorial(5))` after Division line.

**Handoff to pytest-edge-tester (WRITE):**
Implement 11 test functions (or ~8-10 if parametrized aggressively) organized in 4 categories. All must fail initially. Use parametrize for multi-case tests. Use pytest.raises for exception testing. Match existing test style in test_calculator.py.

**Handoff to python-code-implementer (upon tester's WRITE report):**
Implement `Calculator.factorial(self, n: int) -> int` in `/home/runner/work/Calculator_bachelor_autoevolution_team/Calculator_bachelor_autoevolution_team/src/calculator.py`. Must:
1. Reject bool (ValueError, "boolean values")
2. Reject float (ValueError, "got float")
3. Reject str (ValueError, "got str")
4. Reject None (ValueError, "got NoneType")
5. Reject negative int (ValueError, "negative numbers")
6. Return 1 for n=0, return 1 for n=1, compute iteratively for n≥2.
7. Return type always int.

Execution order: pytest-edge-tester WRITE → python-code-implementer → pytest-edge-tester VERIFY → commit.
