### 2026-04-24 — Issue #376 V3 Task 2 — Comprehensive Calculator Test Suite Plan

**Task:** Create comprehensive unit test suite for all calculator operations without modifying `src/` logic.

**Key Decisions:**
- Test-only task: zero source code changes to `src/calculator.py` or `src/__main__.py`
- Preserve existing 3 division-by-zero tests; add ~50 new tests covering add, subtract, multiply, divide
- Invalid input tests document actual Python behavior (not prescriptive fixes)
- All floating-point tests use pytest.approx() for precision tolerance
- Organize tests by operation then by scenario type (normal inputs, edge cases, invalid inputs, consistency)

**Architecture Observations:**
- Calculator class is minimal (4 methods, no type checking, no input validation)
- Existing test file has only 3 tests focused on division by zero
- No __init__.py in tests/ directory (simple flat structure)
- Test organization by operation makes maintenance and coverage verification easier

**Patterns Found:**
- pytest fixture pattern already established with `calc` fixture
- All operations perform raw Python operations (a + b, a - b, etc.) with no defensive checks

**Test Specifications Provided:**
- Addition: 9 tests (positive, negative, zero cases, floats, large numbers)
- Subtraction: 9 tests (positive, negative, zero cases, floats, large numbers)
- Multiplication: 10 tests (positive, negative, zero cases, floats, identity element)
- Division: 10 tests (existing 3 + 7 new, floats, zero dividend, zero divisor, large numbers)
- Invalid inputs: 8 tests (strings, None, type mismatches)
- Consistency/cross-operation: 6 tests (inverse operations, commutativity, non-commutativity)

**Handoff to pytest-edge-tester (WRITE):**
Implement ~52 test scenarios in `tests/test_calculator.py`. Keep existing 3 division-by-zero tests. All new tests must initially fail (not yet implemented). Organize by operation for clarity. Use pytest.approx() for floating-point comparisons.

**Handoff to python-code-implementer:**
NO SOURCE CHANGES REQUIRED. This task is test-only. If pytest-edge-tester produces failing tests, the implementer should not modify `src/` to make them pass — only the test suite is being built. The calculator implementation remains as-is.

### 2026-04-24 — Issue #379 — Factorial Operation Feature — DETAILED PLAN EMITTED

**Task:** Add factorial operation to Calculator class. Must handle valid non-negative integers (0→1, 1→1, n≥2→n!), explicitly reject negative integers (ValueError), and reject non-integer types (bool, float, str, None with ValueError).

**Key Decisions:**
- Single new method `factorial(self, n: int) -> int` added to Calculator class.
- Iterative (not recursive) implementation to avoid stack overflow on large n.
- Type validation executed first (bool, float, str, None all rejected with ValueError before value check).
- Value validation executed second (negative integers rejected with ValueError).
- Optional single-line demo added to `src/__main__.py` showing `calc.factorial(5)`.
- Unary operation; does not change class API or require refactoring.

**Architecture Observations (confirmed in source exploration):**
- Calculator class at `/home/runner/work/Calculator_bachelor_autoevolution_team/Calculator_bachelor_autoevolution_team/src/calculator.py` contains 4 methods (add, subtract, multiply, divide), no __init__, pure functions.
- Existing methods perform raw Python operations with no defensive validation.
- Factorial introduces first unary operation but fits existing single-responsibility pattern.
- Type validation for factorial more strict than binary ops, justified by mathematical domain.
- Tests file at `/home/runner/work/Calculator_bachelor_autoevolution_team/Calculator_bachelor_autoevolution_team/tests/test_calculator.py` already contains 3 division tests and 52+ other tests from V3 Task 2.

**Test Specifications Provided to pytest-edge-tester (WRITE):**
- Category 1 (Valid non-negative): 4 tests (0, 1, parametrized 2-10, large 20).
- Category 2 (Negative): 1 parametrized test (-1, -5, -100).
- Category 3 (Non-integers): 4 tests (float, string, None, bool).
- Category 4 (Type/edge): 2 tests (return type is int, match math.factorial).
- Total: 11 test functions with ~15 individual assertions when parametrized.

**Source Changes Plan for python-code-implementer:**
- File 1: `src/calculator.py` — Add method `factorial(self, n: int) -> int` with full input validation (type + value) and iterative computation. Placement: after divide method, before blank line.
- File 2 (optional): `src/__main__.py` — Add single print line `print("Factorial:", calc.factorial(5))` after Division line.

**Handoff to pytest-edge-tester (WRITE):**
Implement 11 test functions (or ~8-10 if parametrized aggressively) organized in 4 categories. All must fail initially. Use parametrize for multi-case tests. Use pytest.raises for exception testing. Match existing test style in test_calculator.py.

**Handoff to python-code-implementer (upon tester's WRITE report):**
Implement `Calculator.factorial(self, n: int) -> int` in `/home/runner/work/Calculator_bachelor_autoevolution_team/Calculator_bachelor_autoevolution_team/src/calculator.py`. Must:
1. Reject bool (ValueError, "boolean values")
2. Reject float (ValueError, "got float")
3. Reject str (ValueError, "got str")
4. Reject None (ValueError, "got NoneType")
5. Reject negative int (ValueError, "negative numbers")
6. Return 1 for n=0, return 1 for n=1, compute iteratively for n≥2.
7. Return type always int.

Execution order: pytest-edge-tester WRITE → python-code-implementer → pytest-edge-tester VERIFY → commit.

### 2026-04-24 — Issue #385 — V3 Task 5 - Expert/team — Interactive User Input Session

**Task:** Add interactive user input to calculator enabling operation selection, variable-arity operand input, result display, and multi-calculation session support.

**Key Decisions:**
- Create two new modules: `operation_registry.py` (operation discovery and arity metadata) and `interactive.py` (session handler)
- Dynamic operation discovery via reflection on Calculator class using `inspect.signature()`
- Unary detection: 1 non-self parameter; binary: 2 non-self parameters
- Interactive session loop: operation prompt → operand prompts (based on arity) → calculation → result display → continue/exit prompt → loop or exit
- Error handling: catch ValueError, ZeroDivisionError, and other exceptions; display error message; ask "Continue? (yes/no):" and allow recovery
- Input parsing: attempt float() conversion; if fails, re-prompt with "Invalid input. Please enter a number."
- Operation selection: numeric (0, 1, 2...) or name-based (TBD by implementer); invalid selection re-prompts
- No modifications to Calculator methods; no changes to operation implementations
- Existing hardcoded demo in `__main__.py` preserved; interactive mode added as new optional path

**Architecture Observations (from source exploration):**
- Calculator class (`/home/runner/work/Calculator_bachelor_autoevolution_team/Calculator_bachelor_autoevolution_team/src/calculator.py`): 12 methods total
  - Binary (5): add, subtract, multiply, divide, power
  - Unary (7): factorial, square, cube, sqrt, cbrt, ln, log10
- No existing operation registry; operations are bare methods on class
- `__main__.py` currently calls hardcoded demo; no interactive entry point
- Test file uses pytest fixture pattern with `calc` fixture; easily extensible
- Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan, cot, asin, acos) mentioned in brief are NOT implemented; task uses only what exists

**Patterns Found:**
- Single-responsibility methods on Calculator class
- Type hints already present on recent methods (factorial, square, cube, etc.)
- Test organization by operation type works well
- Input/output testing requires mocking of `builtins.input` and `builtins.print`

**Test Specifications Provided to pytest-edge-tester (WRITE):**
15 comprehensive interactive scenarios in `tests/test_interactive.py`:
1. Binary operation (add) with valid operands → result displayed
2. Unary operation (factorial) with valid operand → result displayed
3. Unary operation (square) with valid operand → result displayed
4. Invalid operation selection → re-prompt
5. Non-numeric operand → re-prompt
6. Domain error (sqrt of negative) → error message, ask continue, allow recovery
7. Binary operation (divide) with valid operands → result displayed
8. Zero division error → error message, ask continue
9. Multiple calculations in session → both results shown, loop works
10. Factorial with float operand → domain error
11. Operation list displayed at start
12. User chooses "Continue: yes" → loops correctly
13. User chooses "Continue: no" → session exits
14. Operand input with whitespace/type tolerance (if applicable)
15. Float operands for binary operations → calculated correctly

All tests mock `builtins.input` and `builtins.print` to control interaction flow.

**Source Changes Plan for python-code-implementer:**
1. Create `src/operation_registry.py`:
   - Class `OperationRegistry(calculator: Calculator)`
   - Methods: `get_operations() -> List[str]`, `get_arity(op_name: str) -> int`, `call(op_name: str, *args) -> Any`
   - Uses `inspect.signature()` to determine arity
   - Sorted operation list for consistent UI
   - Full type hints

2. Create `src/interactive.py`:
   - Function `run_interactive_session(calculator: Calculator = None) -> None`
   - Function `parse_operand(user_input: str) -> float | int` (attempts float conversion; raises ValueError on fail)
   - Main loop: operation prompt → operand prompts → execute → display result or error → continue/exit
   - All exception handling in loop; no unhandled exceptions leak
   - Uses `input()` and `print()` for user interaction
   - Full type hints

3. Optionally modify `src/__main__.py`:
   - Add import: `from src.interactive import run_interactive_session`
   - Keep hardcoded `main()` unchanged (regression safety)
   - Either: add conditional flag `--interactive` in `if __name__` block, OR add comment noting interactive mode availability
   - Simplest: NO CHANGE to `__main__.py` is acceptable; interactive mode available as importable function

**No Changes to `src/calculator.py`:**
- All 12 existing methods remain unchanged
- No type validation added to binary operations
- No new methods added (trigonometric ops NOT included in this task)

**Handoff to pytest-edge-tester (WRITE):**
Write 15 test scenarios in `tests/test_interactive.py`. All tests must mock `builtins.input` (with list of user inputs in sequence) and `builtins.print` (to capture output). Each test calls `run_interactive_session(calculator)` or similar. Scenarios cover: valid calculations (unary/binary), invalid operation selection, non-numeric operands, domain errors, zero division, session loops, operation list display, continue/exit handling. All tests must FAIL initially (functions don't exist yet).

**Handoff to python-code-implementer (upon tester's WRITE report):**
Implement two new modules and optionally modify `__main__.py` per source changes plan above. Key requirements:
- OperationRegistry must correctly identify arity (1 or 2) for all 12 operations
- Interactive session must support the full flow: list → select → prompt operands → calculate → result/error → continue/exit
- All exceptions caught and handled gracefully; user can recover from any error
- Input parsing robust (float conversion, re-prompt on failure)
- Operation selection validation (re-prompt on invalid)
- Session loop correctly implements "Continue? (yes/no):" logic

Execution order: pytest-edge-tester WRITE → python-code-implementer → pytest-edge-tester VERIFY → commit.
